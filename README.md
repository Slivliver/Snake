# Snake
The good old snake game, written in c# by me, with few extensions. The game is playing in the console and includes three modes: machine learning, fixed algorithm that plays the game and a regular humen player mod.
In the program, you can play by yourself, play against my algorithm, place my algorithm versus itself, teach a neural network to play the game by evolution and test the neural network versus my algorithm.
